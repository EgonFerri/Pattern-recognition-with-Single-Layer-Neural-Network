# Pattern recognition with Single Layer Neural Network

The aim of this project is to develop an application, based on the unconstrained optimization
algorithms studied in this course, that allow to recognize the numbers in a sequence of
blurred digits. The procedure to achieve that goal will be to formulate a Single Layer Neural
Network that is going to be trained to recognize the different numbers with First Derivative
Optimization methods.
All the code and the partial result can be found in the folder. At the end of this document
there is a summary that describe them.
